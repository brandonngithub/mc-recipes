        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Cookies are food items that can be obtained in large quantities, 
            but do not restore hunger or saturation significantly. 
            To eat a cookie, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. 
            Eating one restores 2 hunger and 0.4 hunger saturation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Journeyman-level farmer villagers sell 18 cookies for 3 emeralds as part of their trades. 
            In Java Edition, if the player has the Hero of the Village effect, a farmer villager may gift them a cookie.
