        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Unlike most food, the cake cannot be eaten as an item in the hotbar. 
            Before being eaten, it must first be placed on top of a solid block. 
            Placing the cake on a slab also works, as the slab acts like a solid block. 
            The cake instead floats half a block on top of the slab.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each cake has seven "slices"; each use consumes one slice progressing inward from the west. 
            A single slice restores 2 hunger and 0.4 hunger saturation. 
            Eating all seven slices of a cake restores 14 hunger and 2.8 hunger saturation.
