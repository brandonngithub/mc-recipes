## ~ recipes ~
<p>The very first project from TheOdinProject (Foundations Course).</p>
<p>A simple webpage to showcase basic HTML knowledge without CSS styling. Clicking on a recipe will show the instructions and ingredients required to make the dish. Done with a little Minecraft twist! Through this project I learned how to operate the terminal, use basic git, and write clean code that is understandable to others. In HTML I learned how to create a boilerplate, headers, paragraphs, images, links, and lists. </p>
